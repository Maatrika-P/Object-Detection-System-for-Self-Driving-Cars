# Self-Driving Car Object Detection and Segmentation üöóüì∑

üöóüí° This project focuses on developing advanced object detection and segmentation systems for self-driving cars. Utilizing the BDD100K dataset, we aim to enhance a car's ability to perceive and comprehend its environment, ensuring safer autonomous driving.

## Overview

In recent years, self-driving cars have emerged as a transformative technology with the potential to reshape transportation systems. The foundation of autonomous vehicles is their ability to perceive and understand the environment. Object detection and segmentation are fundamental components of a self-driving car's perception system, as they allow the vehicle to identify and comprehend its surroundings, including other vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs, lane markings, and obstacles.

## Dataset

üìÇ Leveraged the BDD100K dataset, which provides a diverse collection of images and annotations, including object detection, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation. This dataset serves as the cornerstone for training and testing our self-driving car perception system.

## Models Experimenting with 

üîç We will explore various models for object detection and segmentation, with a primary focus on the following:

1. **Faster R-CNN**: A region-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that excels in object detection. It's known for its balance between speed and accuracy, making it suitable for real-time applications.

2. **Mask R-CNN**: An extension of Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN also provides instance segmentation. This model is essential for recognizing and differentiating objects within the same class.

3. **U-Net**: its a convolutional neural network architecture designed for semantic segmentation tasks, featuring a U-shaped encoder-decoder structure to capture fine-grained image details.
